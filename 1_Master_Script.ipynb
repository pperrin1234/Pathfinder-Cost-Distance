    "### To Do\n",
    "- IDEA: make a recursive, two-phase cost-distance map. The first uses just terrain layers, and produces a cost-distance map. Then based on that map, I start simulating the construction of road networks. I assume that the modern road network bears no relation to some ancient one, as ancient roads fell into disrepair and stopped being used. More broadly, it assumes that road networks are determined by the distances of large cities to one another.\n",
    "- So then, once I have the major road network, I then path from the next tier of cities to all cities of higher tiers around them--ex: if nearby two major cities, then create road network for both, taking advantage of the existing network.\n",
    "- The idea here is that this'll organically create a realistic looking network, one which takes into account both natural terrain and the spatial distribution of major cities.\n",
    "- So then I repeat this, going down a tier each time. First, large cities create a road network between themselves, then minor cities connect to nearby major cities, then towns to nearby minor cities, and so on.\n",
    "- I may potentially need to rewrite this so settlements below cities path only to the tier directly above, if I end up generating far too elaborate road networks. This isn't the modern day, after all! But, then again, 'road network' often means a dirt path. So maybe make the roads vary in quality--so roads between major cities are highest tier, and from villages lowest. And in practice, the layers would be which places are *not* a given quality of road. And maybe the penalty would scale with distance from roads? (No, probably a bad idea--increases computation time without really adding much, I think.)"
