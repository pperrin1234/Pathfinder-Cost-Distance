# Pathfinder Cost Distance Map Project

### Summary

I started this project for a tabletop roleplaying game I'm in with some friends, playing the famous Kingmaker adventure path from Pathfinder 2nd Edition.

This project uses data from the Pathfinder Wiki Mapping Project [LINK] to do several things:

1) Prepare data for mapping in QGIS

2) Create a cost distance map through Google Earth Engine

In the future, I intend to work on it more to make additional maps and conduct more advanced cost distance mapping.

### Instructions

The repository contains a .zip folder and some scripts. Download and unzip the .zip folder to access all the code and source data needed. Those same scripts are also in the repository, to make it easier to view the code.
